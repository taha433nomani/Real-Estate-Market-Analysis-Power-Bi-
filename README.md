## Real-Estate-Market-Analysis-Dashboard
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze property pricing trends, renovation impact, construction patterns, luxury segmentation, and location-based performance in the real estate market.

## Short Description / Purpose

The Real Estate Market Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI report designed to explore 21,613 property records and uncover insights related to pricing distribution, property characteristics, renovation impact, and geographic trends.

This dashboard is intended for real estate investors, property consultants, market analysts, and decision-makers who want to evaluate market performance and make data-driven investment decisions.

## Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.

• Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.

• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures such as average price, renovation impact percentage, and property segmentation.

• Data Modeling – Relationships created between property details, renovation status, and location tables to enable cross-filtering.

• File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

## Data Source

Source: Real estate property dataset (housing market data).

The dataset includes over 21,000 property records containing:

Property location (Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, etc.)

Property price

Year built

Renovation status

Condition status (Very Good, Good, Bad)

Luxury / Non-Luxury classification

Bedroom count

Floor levels

Property age group

The data is structured to support time-based analysis, property characteristic comparison, and price distribution insights.

## Features / Highlights

• Business Problem

The real estate market is influenced by factors such as property age, renovation status, luxury classification, number of bedrooms, floor levels, and geographic location. Investors and analysts often struggle to understand:

Which locations have the highest property value?
Does renovation significantly increase property price?
How do luxury properties compare to non-luxury ones?
How does property age affect pricing?
What construction trends are visible over time?

Answering these questions manually from raw data is inefficient and complex.

• Goal of the Dashboard

To build an interactive Power BI dashboard that:

Enables users to analyze pricing trends and property distribution.
Evaluates renovation impact on property value.
Compares luxury vs non-luxury market segments.
Identifies high-performing locations.
Analyzes time-based construction and renovation trends.
